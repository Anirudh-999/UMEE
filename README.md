##Features  

### Backend Architecture  
1. **Flask Application**  
   - Serves static files and links all pages together.  
2. **gRPC Service**  
   - Enables real-time communication with methods for:  
     - Bi-directional messaging  
     - Batch additions of friends  
3. **Database Abstraction Layer**  
   - Placeholder setup for PostgreSQL integration with support for user, friend, message, and community models.  
4. **Authentication**  
   - Placeholder for JWT-based authentication integration.  

### Frontend Architecture  
- **Home Page:** Highlights app features and links to other sections.  
- **Friends Page:** Displays current friends, allows adding new ones, and redirects to individual chats.  
- **Chat Page:**  
  - Real-time messaging with gRPC bi-directional streaming.  
  - Typing indicators and timestamps.  
- **Explore Page:** Provides options for joining communities with a responsive layout.  
- **Login Page:** Placeholder for authentication implementation.
